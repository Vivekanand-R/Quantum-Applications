# Quantum Applications

Quantum Computers (QC) will compute things in a different way. Currently, computers use normal bits O's or 1's to perform and compute mathematical operations, whereas in QC we use Qubits to perform operations.

To Understand Quantum computers, we need to understand below basic concepts to get started:

Shor's Algorithm,
Logical Operations (Bits Vs Qubits),
Three Fundamental Principles: Superposition, Entanglement and Quantum Interference,
Gates (Single Qubits, Two Qubits, Multi Qubits and parametric Operations), 
Error Correction Techniques, and
List of commercially available processors today. 


Types of Quantum Gates

Pauli Gates (X, Y, Z): These are like quantum versions of flipping states, with the X gate being a bit like a NOT gate. Y and Z gates rotate qubits in different ways along the Bloch sphere (which represents a qubit's state).,

Hadamard Gate (H): This H gate puts a qubit into a superposition, where it’s in a mix of 0 and 1 until measured. It’s often the first step in quantum algorithms.

CNOT Gate: Like a conditional operation, it flips a target qubit if a control qubit is in state 1, creating entanglement (a spooky link between qubits) essential for quantum processing.

While it is too early for practical commercializations and solving complex problems like encryption, drug discovery, other computational problems., but it doesn't prevent us to develop sample circuits using compilers.
